## What is this?

A simple visual tool that answers a common question: **what would $10,000 have grown to over a 40-year career if you invested it differently?**

It simulates someone starting at age 25 and retiring at 65, using real historical returns from 1985 through 2024.

## The three strategies compared

1. **100% S&P 500** — All in on the 500 largest US companies. Simple, popular, and historically dominant.

2. **100% Total US Stock Market** — Same idea but includes mid-cap and small-cap stocks too (using Vanguard's VTSMX/VTSAX). Slightly more diversified than S&P 500 alone.

3. **Age-in-Bonds** — The classic rule of thumb where you hold your age (minus some offset) as a percentage in bonds, and the rest in stocks. The idea is that as you get older and closer to retirement, you shift more into bonds to reduce volatility and protect what you've built. Two variations are included:
   - **Age minus 10:** At 25 you hold 15% bonds / 85% stocks, gradually shifting to 55% bonds / 45% stocks at 65.
   - **Age minus 20:** At 25 you hold 5% bonds / 95% stocks, gradually shifting to 45% bonds / 55% stocks at 65. More aggressive — stays heavier in stocks longer.

## The thinking

The conventional wisdom says you should diversify into bonds as you age. And that's not wrong — bonds smooth out the ride. In 2008, the S&P 500 dropped 37%. If you were 48 years old with age-minus-10 allocation, your bond cushion would have softened that blow.

But the tradeoff is real. Over 40 years, that "safety" costs you a significant chunk of your final balance. The data shows exactly how much.

This isn't advice — it's just history. Past returns don't guarantee future results. But seeing the actual numbers side by side helps you understand what you're giving up (and what you're gaining) with each approach.
